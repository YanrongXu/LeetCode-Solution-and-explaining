Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the <strong>longest</strong> path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root:

#### Example:
Given a binary tree
```
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
```
Return <strong>3</strong>, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
<strong>Note:</strong> The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of deges between them.

### DFS (Post-Order)
```python
Step:
1.  edge check:
  1.  check if there is not node, return 0
  2.  check if there is not left child node, and not right child node. return 0
2.  initial a longestPath to 0
3.  call a recursive funtion maxdepth and pass in root
4.  return the longestPath

5.  MaxDepth Function:
  1.  check is there is not root: return 0
  2.  find the depth for left
  3.  find the depth for right
  4.  find the longestPath by checking current longestpath and (leftDepth + rightDepth), see which are biggest
  5.  return the max of left or righ depth, and add 1
  
def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root):
    if not root:
        return 0
    if not root.left and not root.right:
        return 0
    self.longestPath = 0
    self.findDepth(root)
    return self.longestPath
    
def findDepth(self, root):
    if not root:
        return 0
    leftDepth = self.findDepth(root.left)
    rightDepth = self.findDepth(root.right)
    self.longestPath = max(longestPath, leftDepth + rightDepth)
    return max(leftDepth, rightDepth) + 1
```
