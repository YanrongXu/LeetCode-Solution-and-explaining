Consider all the leaves of a binary tree, from left to right order, the values of those leaves from a <strontg>leaf value sequence</strong>.
![](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/16/tree.png)
For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is `(6, 7, 4, 9, 8)`.
Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.
Return `true` if and only if the two given trees with head nodes `root1` and `root2` are leaf-similar.

#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/03/leaf-similar-1.jpg)
```
Input: root1 = [3,5,1,6,2,9,8,null,null,7,4], root2 = [3,5,1,6,7,4,2,null,null,null,null,null,null,9,8]
Output: true
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: root1 = [1], root2 = [1]
Output: true
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: root1 = [1], root2 = [2]
Output: false
```

#### Example 4:
```
Input: root1 = [1,2], root2 = [2,2]
Output: true
```

#### Example 5:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/03/leaf-similar-2.jpg)
```
Input: root1 = [1,2,3], root2 = [1,3,2]
Output: false
```

#### Constraints:
  * The number of nodes in each tree will be in the range `[1, 200]`.
  * Both of the given trees will have values in the range `[0, 200]`.

### Recurisve (dfs)
```python
Step:
1.  create empty leaf1 and leaf2 array
2.  call dfs for both root1, and root2 and remember pass in the root and leaf
3   return check if leaf1 and leaf2 are the same

4.  dfs function:
  1. if root:
    1.  if not root.left and not root.right:
      1.  append the root to the leaf
    2.  call the dfs for root.left
    3.  call the dfs for rooo.right

def leafSimilar(self, root1, root2):
    leaf1, leaf2 = [], []
    leafCheck1, leafCheck1 = self.dfs(root1, leaf1), self.dfs(root2, leaf2)
    return leaf1 == leaf2
    
def dfs(self, node, leaf):
    if not node:
        return
    if not node.left and not node.right:
        leaf.append(node.val)
    self.dfs(node.left, leaf)
    self.dfs(node.right, leaf)
```
