Give an Array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of 
the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

#### Example
Given the sorted array: `[-10,-3,0,5,9]`,
one <strong>possible</strong> answer is: `[0,-3,9,-10,null,5]`, which represents the following
height balanced BST:
```
      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```

Recursive (DFS):
```python
Step:
1. Edge case, check for the array
2. Use a helper function to find the the midpoing of tha nums and recursive call if needed
    1.  check is the left(current being point) and right(current end point) are meet
    2.  find the midpoint of the nums array with current left and right point
    3.  save the midpoint of the array as root
    4.  find the left and right of the root by set left and right
    5.  return the root
3. return the helper point

def sortedArrayToBST(self, nums):
    if not nums:
        return None
    
    return self.helper(nums, 0, len(nums) - 1)
    
def helper(self, nums, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return None
    
    mid = (left + right) // 2
    root = TreeNode(nums[mid])
    root.left = self.helper(nums, left, mid - 1)
    root.right = self.helper(nums, mid + 1, right)
    return root
```
