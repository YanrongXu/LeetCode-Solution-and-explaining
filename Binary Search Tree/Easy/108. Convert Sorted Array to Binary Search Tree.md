Give an Array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of 
the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

#### Example
Given the sorted array: `[-10,-3,0,5,9]`,
one <strong>possible</strong> answer is: `[0,-3,9,-10,null,5]`, which represents the following
height balanced BST:
```
      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```
Iterative:
```python
Step:
1.  check if there is numsin the array
2.  create a stack to store left, right, parent, and direction
3.  create a root node
4.  loop through the stack:
    1.  the the thing out of the stack
    2.  find the midpoint with current left and right point
    3.  find the node with current node
    4.  check do we have parent for current node, place the node to root node we create early
    5.  if parent exists, check the direction of the node, and place the node in the correct direction
    6.  check if the current mid point if great the left point, or less than right point, append the left right mid directon to the stack
5.  return the root

def sortedArrayToBST(self, nums):
    if not nums:
        return None
    
    stack = [(0, len(nums) - 1, None, None)]
    root = None
    
    while stack:
        left, right, parent, dire = stack.pop()
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        node = TreeNode(nums[mid])
        
        if not parent:
            root = node
        else:
            if dire == 'l':
                parent.left  = node
            else:
                parent.right = node
        if mid > left:
            stack.append((left, mid - 1, node, 'l'))
        if mid < right:
            stack.append((mid + 1, right, node, 'r'))
            
    return root
```

Recursive (DFS):
```python
Step:
1. Edge case, check for the array
2. Use a helper function to find the the midpoing of tha nums and recursive call if needed
    1.  check is the left(current being point) and right(current end point) are meet
    2.  find the midpoint of the nums array with current left and right point
    3.  save the midpoint of the array as root
    4.  find the left and right of the root by set left and right
    5.  return the root
3. return the helper point

def sortedArrayToBST(self, nums):
    if not nums:
        return None
    
    return self.helper(nums, 0, len(nums) - 1)
    
def helper(self, nums, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return None
    
    mid = (left + right) // 2
    root = TreeNode(nums[mid])
    root.left = self.helper(nums, left, mid - 1)
    root.right = self.helper(nums, mid + 1, right)
    return root
```
