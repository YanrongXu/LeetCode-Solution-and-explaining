Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definnition of LCA on Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor) "The lowest common ancestor is defined between tow nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow <strong>a node to be a descendant of itself</strong>)."

#### Example 1:
![example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)
```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
```

#### Example 2:
![example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)
```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2
```

#### Constraints:
  * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 10^5]`
  * `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
  * All `Node.val` are <strong>unique</strong>.
  * `p != q`
  * `p` and `q` will exists in the BST.


### Iterative:
```python
Step:
1.  EdgeCheck: check if there a root
2.  while loop the root when the root is exist
  1.  check if the p.val and q.val is less than root.val: if both less than root.val, it mean the LCA will be on left of the root node
    1.  set the root to root.left
  2.  check if the p.val and q.val is more than root.val: if both more than root.val, it mean the LCA will be on the right of the root node
    1.  set the root to root.right
  3. else, if either of p.val or q.val is equal to root.val
    1.  return the root

def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
    if not root:
        return
    
    while root:
        if p.val < root.val and q.val < root.val:
            root = root.left
        elif p.val > root.val and q.val > root.val:
            root = root.right
        else:
            break
    return root
```

### Recursive:
```python
Step:
1.  edge check: check if there is root node, if not just return nothing
2.  check if p.val and q.val are both less the root.val:
  1.  return recursive call lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
3.  check if p.val and q.val are both more than root.val:
  1.  return recursive call lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
4.  return the root

def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
    if not root:
        return
    if p.val < root.val and q.val < root.val:
        return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
    elif p.val > root.val and q.val > root.val:
        return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
    return root
```
