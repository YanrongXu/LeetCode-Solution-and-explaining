Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definnition of LCA on Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor) "The lowest common ancestor is defined between tow nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow <strong>a node to be a descendant of itself</strong>)."
