Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the sum of every tree node's <strong>tilt</strong>.

The <strong>tilt</strong> of a tree node is the <strong>absolute difference</strong> between the sum of all left subtree node <strong>values</strong> and all right subtree node <strong>values</strong>. If a node does not have a left child, then the sum of the left subtree node <strong>values</strong> is treated a `0`. The rule is similar if there the node does not have a right child.

#### Example 1:
![example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/20/tilt1.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Tilt of node 2 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tile of node 1 : |2-3| = 1 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 2; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 3)
Sum of every tilt : 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
```

#### Example 2:
![example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/20/tilt2.jpg)
```
Input: root = [4,2,9,3,5,null,7]
Output: 15
Explanation: 
Tilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 5 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 7 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 2 : |3-5| = 2 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 3; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 5)
Tilt of node 9 : |0-7| = 7 (no left child, so sum is 0; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 7)
Tilt of node 4 : |(3+5+2)-(9+7)| = |10-16| = 6 (left subtree values are 3, 5, and 2, which sums to 10; right subtree values are 9 and 7, which sums to 16)
Sum of every tilt : 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
```

#### Example 3:
![example 3](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/20/tilt3.jpg)
```
Input: root = [21,7,14,1,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: 9
```

#### Constraints:
  * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`
  * `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
  
### Recursive (DFS)
```python
Step:
1.  check if not root: return 0
2.  initial res to 0
3.  call dfs to root
4.  return res

5.  dfs function:
  1.  check if not root: return 0
  2.  find the left val
  3.  find teh the right val
  4.  find the abs value of left - right and add to the res
  5.  return root.val + left + right

def findTilt(self, root):
    if not root:
        return 0
    self.res = 0
    self.dfs(root)
    return res
    
def dfs(root):
    if not root:
        return 0
    left = self.dfs(root.left)
    right = self.dfs(root.right)
    
    self.res += abs(left - right)
    return root.val + left + right
```
