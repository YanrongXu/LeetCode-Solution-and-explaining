Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node, down to the farthest leaf node.

Nary-Tree input serializtion is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value.

#### Example 1:
![example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/narytreeexample.png)
```
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: 3
```

#### Example 2:
![example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/08/sample_4_964.png)
```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: 5
```

#### Constraints:
  * The depth of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to `1000`.
  * The total number of nodes is between `[0, 10^4]`
  
### Recursive (DFS)
```python
Step:
1.  check if there a node
2.  inital a height as 0
3.  for loop the root children
  1.  find the depth of children by call the function itself, by input are the children node
  2.  find the height by find the compare height and depth, and see which have biggest number
4.  return height + 1

def maxDepth(self, root):
    if not root:
        return 0
    height = 0
    for i in root.children:
        depth = self.maxDepth(i)
        height = max(height, depth)
    return height + 1
```
