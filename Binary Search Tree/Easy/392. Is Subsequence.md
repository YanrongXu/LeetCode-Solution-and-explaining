Given two strings `s` and `t`, check if `s` is a <strong>subsequence</strong> of `t`.

A <Strong>subsequence</strong> of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `ace` is a sebsequence of `abcde` while `aec` is not).

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

#### Constraints:
  * `0 <= s.length <= 100`
  * `0 <= t.length <= 10^4`
  * `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.
  
<Strong>Follow up:</strong> If there are lots of incoming `s`, say `s1, s2, ..., sk` where `k >= 10^9`, and you want to check one by one to see if `t` has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

### Two Pointer
```python
Step:
1.  check if the s is exits and if there is not t, we can return False
2.  creata a left and right pointer and set both to 0
3.  a while loop for both s and t string using length, and make sure the left and right is less than the length of both s and t
  1.  check if s[left] == t[right]:
    1.  if match the left += 1
  2.  add 1 to the right
4.  check if left and match the len(s)

def isSubsequence(self, s, t):
    if s and not t:
        return False
    
    left, right = 0, 0
    while left < len(s) and right < len(t):
        if s[left] == t[right]:
            left += 1
        right += 1
    return left == len(s)
```
