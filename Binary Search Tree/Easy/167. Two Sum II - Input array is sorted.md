Give nan array of integers `numbers` that is already <strong>sorted in ascending order</strong>, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number.

Return the indices of the two numbers (<strong>1-indexed</strong>) as an integer array `answer` of size `2`, where `1 <= answer[0] < answer[1] <= numbers.length`.

You may assume that each input would have <strong>exactly one solution</strong> and you <strong>may not</strong> use the same element twice.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
```

#### Constraints:
  * `2 <= numbers.length <= 3 8 10^4`
  * `-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000`
  * `numbers` is sorted in <strong>increasing order</strong>
  * `-1000 <= target <= 1000`
  * <strong>Only one valid answer exists.</strong>

### Two Pointer:
```python
Step:
1.  declare start and end point
2.  do a while loop, and stop when start meet end
    1.  declare currentSum = numbers[start] + numbers[end]
    2.  check if currentSum = target
        1.  return start and end point but need to add 1 to both
    3.  check if currentSum large the target
        1.  minus 1 from end
    4.  check if currentSum small the target:
        1. add 1 to start

def twoSum(self, numbers, target):
    start, end = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    
    while start + 1 <= end:
        currentSum = numbers[start] + number[end]
        if currentSum == target:
            return [start + 1, end + 1]
        elif currentSum > target:
            end -= 1
        else:
            start += 1
```
