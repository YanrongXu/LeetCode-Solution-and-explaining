You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1
```

#### Constraints:
  * `1 <= bad <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

```python
Step:
1.  set a start and end point, since in this question we start at 1, we set the start to 1, end to n
2.  while loop from start to end
  1.  set a mid point
  2.  check if mid point are bad:
    1. if bad: let end = mid
    2.  not bad: start = mid
3.  check is start are the bad verison:
  1. if return true, return start
  2. else return end

def firstBadVersion(self, n):
    start, end = 1, n
    while start + 1 < end:
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        if isBadVersion(mid):
            end = mid
        else:
            start = mid
    
    if isBadVersion(start):
        return start
    return end
```
