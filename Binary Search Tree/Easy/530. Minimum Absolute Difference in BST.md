Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, find the minimum absolute difference between values of any two nodes.


#### Example:
```
Input:

   1
    \
     3
    /
   2

Output:
1

Explanation:
The minimum absolute difference is 1, which is the difference between 2 and 1 (or between 2 and 3).
```
#### Note:
  * There are at least two nodes in this BST.
  * This question is same as 783: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-distance-between-bst-nodes/

### Recurisve (DFS, In-order)
```python
Step:
1.  create a pre min and minDiff varible
2.  doing Inorder DFS, but firest check root:
  1.  check if ther a root:
  2.  DFS the left child root
  3.  check if pre is Not None:
    1.  check which have the minimum difference, minDiff or (root.val - self.pre)
  4.  set the self.pre = root.val
  5.  DFS the right child root
3.  return self.minDiff

def getMinimumDifference(self, root):
    self.pre = None
    self.minDiff = sys.maxsize
    self.searchMin(root)
    return self.minDiff
    
def searchMin(self, root):
    if not root:
        return
    self.searchMin(root.left)
    if self.pre != None:
        self.minDiff = min(self.minDiff, root.val - self.pre)
    self.pre = root.val
    self.searchMin(root.right)
```

### Iterative (DFS)
```python
Step:
1.  create a pre to save pre value as None, and minDiff to a maxsize
2.  creat a node and set as root
3.  creata a empty queue 
4.  while loop the queue
  1.  check if there a node:
    1.  if yes, add node to the queue
    2.  set node as node.left
  2.  else:
    1.  pop the node from the queue:
    2.  check is the pre is None:
      1.  if not, check which have minDiff, minDiff or (nodo.val - pre)
    3.  set pre to node.val
    4.  set node to node.right
5.  return minDiff

def getMinimumDifference(self, root):
    pre = None
    minDiff = sys.maxsize
    node = root
    queue = []
    
    while queue or node:
        if node:
            queue.append(root.left)
            node = node.left
        else:
            node = queue.pop()
            if pre != None:
                minDiff = min(minDiff, node.val - pre)
            pre = node.val
            node = node.right
    return minDiff
```
