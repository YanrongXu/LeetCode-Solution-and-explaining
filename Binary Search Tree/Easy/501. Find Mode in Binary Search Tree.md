Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:
  * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys <strong>less than or equal to</strong> node node's key.
  * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with <strong>greater than or equal to</strong> the node's key.
  * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

#### Example:
Given BST `[1, null, 2, 2]`
```
   1
    \
     2
    /
   2
```
return `[2]`
<strong>Note:</strong> If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.
<strong>Follow up:</strong> Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).

### Iterative (Bruth Force)
```python
Step:
1.  check is there a root node, if not return empty array
2.  save the root into queue
3.  create a dict to store the key and number of time it show on the tree
4.  create a max_count to store the current max count for the key
5.  create a answer to store answer in array
6.  loop through the queue:
  1.  pop the node out of queue
  2.  check if the node.val is in the res:
    1. if not, save the res[node.val] = 1
    2.  if yes, res[node.val] += 1
  3.  check if left child node:
    1.  append the left child node to the queue
  4.  check if right node node:
    1.  append the right child node to the queue
7.  loop throug the res:
  1.  check if count for the res[num] is equal to the max_cout:
    1.  if do, append the num to the answer
  2.  check if res[num] is great than max_count
    1.  reset the answer as [num]
    2.  and set the max_count as res[num]
  3. else; continue  
8.  return answer

def findMode(self, root):
    if not root:
        return []
    
    queue = [root]
    res = {}
    max_count = 0
    answer = []
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.pop(0)
        if node.val not in res:
            res[node.val] = 1
        else:
            res[node.val] += 1
        if node.left:
            queue.append(node.left)
        if node.right:
            queue.append(node.right)
    
    for num in res:
        if res[num] == max_count:
            answer.append(num)
        elif res[num] > max_count:
            answer = [num]
            max_count = res[num]
        else:
            continue
    return answer
```
