Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum Depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

<strong>Note:</strong> A leaf is a node with no children.

#### Example 1:
![example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/12/ex_depth.jpg)
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 2
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Output: 5
```

#### Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^5]
* -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

Iterative (Personaly recommanding solution, is can solve extermine rare edge case, such as left node all the way)
```
Step:
1.  edge check, check if there is a root node
2.  create a queue to store by root and depth of current root node
3.  loop through the queue using while statement
    1.  pop the first node and depth out of queue
    2.  see if both left and right children node exists
        1. if both not existis return the current depth
    3.  check if there is left children node:
        1. append the left node and add 1 to the current depth(the depth for passdown, but not change the depth)
    4.  check if there is right children node:
        1. append the right node and add 1 to the current depth(the depth for passdown, but not change the depth)
     
```
