Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum Depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

<strong>Note:</strong> A leaf is a node with no children.

#### Example 1:
![example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/12/ex_depth.jpg)
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 2
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Output: 5
```

#### Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^5]`
* -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

Iterative (BFS) (Personaly recommanding solution, is can solve extermine rare edge case, such as left node all the way)
```python
Step:
1.  edge check, check if there is a root node
2.  create a queue to store by root and depth of current root node
3.  loop through the queue using while statement
    1.  pop the first node and depth out of queue
    2.  see if both left and right children node exists
        1. if both not existis return the current depth
    3.  check if there is left children node:
        1. append the left node and add 1 to the current depth(the depth for passdown, but not change the depth)
    4.  check if there is right children node:
        1. append the right node and add 1 to the current depth(the depth for passdown, but not change the depth)

def minDepth(self, root):
    if not root:
        return 0
    
    queue = [(root, 1)]
    while queue:
        node, depth = queue.pop(0)
        if not node.left and not node.right:
            return depth
        if node.left:
            queue.append((node.left, depth + 1))
        if node.right:
            queue.append((node.right, depth + 1))
```

Recursive (DFS)
```
Step:
1.  Check if there is node at current root
    1. if not return 0
2.  if there is not left and right children node
    1. mean we are on the leaf node, return 1
3.  set a min_depth with max number
4.  check if there a left children node
    1.  check the mindepth for left and compare with current min_depth and save as mindepth
5.  check if there is right chidlren node:
    1.  check the mindepth for right and compare with current min_depth and save as mindepth
6.  return the min depth + 1

def minDepth(self, root):
    if not root:
        return 0
    
    if not root.left and not root.right:
        return 1
    
    min_depth = sys.maxsize
    
    if root.left:
        min_depth = min(self.minDepth(root.left), min_depth)
    if root.right:
        min_depth = min(self.minDepth(root.right), min_depth)
        
    return min_depth + 1
```
