Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.

Since the return type is integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

Iterative (Time-Limit Exceeded):
```python
Step:
1. create a varible result to save the final result
2. loop from 0 to x + 1, because with for loop it only loop through the number before x
  1. check i * i is equal to x, if equal it mean we find the sqrt, return the i
  2. else if i * i is less than x, save it as result first, and we loop through the next i
  3. check is i * i is great than x, it it are great than x, it mean the preview number we save in the result are the answer
3. return the result

def mySqrt(self, x):
  result = 0
  for i in range(x + 1)
    if i * i == x:
      return i
    elif i * i < x:
      result = i
    else:
      break
  return result

```

Binary Search:
```python
Step:
1. solve the edge case 0 and 1
2. set a start and end point
3. compare the value between start and end point:
  1. set a midpoint
  2. check if midpoint * midpoint is equal to x
    1. if true, return the midpoint
  3. check if midpoint * midpoint is great than x
    1. if true, set the endpoint to the midpoint
  4. check if midpoint * midpoint is less than x
    1. if true, set the startpoint to the midpoint
4. check if start * start is equal to x:
  if true, return start
5. check if end * end is great than x:
  if true, that mean the start is the bigest integer we can go, so return the start
  
def mySqrt(self, x):
  if x == 0:
    return 0
  if x == 1:
    return 1
  
  start, end = 0, x
  while start + 1 < end:
    mid = (start + end) // 2
    if mid * mid == x:
      return mid
    elif mid * mid > x:
      end = mid
    else:
      start = mid
  if start * start == x:
    return start
  else:
    return start
```
