Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.

Since the return type is integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

Iterative (Time-Limit Exceeded):
```python:
Step:
1. create a varible result to save the final result
2. loop from 0 to x + 1, because with for loop it only loop through the number before x
  1. check i * i is equal to x, if equal it mean we find the sqrt, return the i
  2. else if i * i is less than x, save it as result first, and we loop through the next i
  3. check is i * i is great than x, it it are great than x, it mean the preview number we save in the result are the answer
3. return the result

def mySqrt(self, x):
  result = 0
  for i in range(x + 1)
    if i * i == x:
      return i
    elif i * i < x:
      result = i
    else:
      break
  return result

```
