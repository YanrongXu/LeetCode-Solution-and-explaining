You hava a total of n coins that you want to form a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of <strong>full</strong> staricase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

#### Example 1:
```
n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```

#### Example 2:
```
n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```

```python
Step:
1.  check if there n is 0: return 0
2.  set a start and end, as 0, n
3.  while loop start is less than end
  1.  find the midpoint
  2.  find the equation which are (mid + 1) * mid / 2
  3.  check if equation equal to n:
    1. if true return mid
  4.  if equation greater than n:
    1.  end = mid
  5.  if equation less than n:
    1.  start = mid
4.  check if (end + 1) * end / 2 == n:
  1.  return end
5.  return start

def arrangeCoins(self, n):
    if not n:
        return 0
    
    start, end = 0, n
    while start + 1 < end:
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        equation = (mid + 1) * mid / 2
        if equation == n:
            return mid
        elif equation > n:
            end = mid
        else:
            start = mid
    
    if (end + 1) * end / 2 == n:
        return end
    return start
```
