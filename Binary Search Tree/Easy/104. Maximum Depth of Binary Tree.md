Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's <strong>maximum depth</strong> is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

#### Example 1:
![Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/tmp-tree.jpg)
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: root = []
Output: 0
```

#### Example 4:
```
Input: root = [0]
Output: 1
```

Iterative:
```python
Step:
1. Edge Case Check if there is node
2. Create a variable to save the max depth
3. create a queue to save the root
3. check if there is node in check loop:
  1. because there is node, that mean we are on one the level, and add 1 to the depth
  2. because we are check for the depth, some level may have multiple node, we need to elimate that, and some node may skill have child, we need make sure we count it,
     so we check the len of queue to make sure how many node in this level.
     1. pop the first node out of the queue
     2. check the current node, see if there is left or right child and add it to the queue
4. return the max_depth

def maxDepth(self, root):
  if not root:
    return 0
  
  queue, max_depth = [root], 0
  while queue:
    max_depth += 1
    for i in range(len(queue)):
      current = queue.pop(0)
      if current.left:
        queue.append(current.left)
      if current.right:
        queue.append(current.right)
  return max_depth
```
