We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a nubmer from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number i picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `def guess(num)`, which returns `3` possible results:
  * `-1`: The number I picked is lower than your guess (i.e. `pick < num`)
  * `1`: The number I picked is higher than your guess (i.e. `pick > num`)
  * `0`: The number I picked is equal to your guess (i.e. `pick == num`)
return the number that I picked.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

#### Example 4:
```
Input: n = 2, pick = 2
Output: 2
```

#### Constraints:
  * `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`
  * `1 <= pick <= n`
  
### Binary Search
```python
Step:
1.  set a start and end point
2.  while loop start + 1 < end:
  1.  find the midpoint
  2.  check the midpoint in the guess, see if it equal to 0
    1. if equal to 0 return mid
  3.  check if guess equal to -1:
    1. if equal to -1, set mid to the end
  4. else:
    1. set the mid to the start
3. check if guess start == 0
  1. if equal to 0 return start
4. else return end

def guessNumber(self, n):
    start, end = 1, n
    while start + 1 < end:
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        if guess(mid) == 0:
            return mid
        elif guess(mid) == -1:
            end = mid
        else:
            start = mid
    if guess(start) == 0:
        return start
    return end
```
