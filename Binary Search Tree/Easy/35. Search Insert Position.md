Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the <strong>index</strong> if the target is found.
If not, return the <strong>index</strong> where it would be if it were inserted order.

###### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
```
###### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1
```
###### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4
```
###### Example 4:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 0
Output: 0
```
###### Example 5:
```
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: 0
```

#### Iterative (Bruth Force Way)
```python
1. Check if there is anything is the nums and anything in target
2. loop through the nums
  1. we knew that it is a sorting array, we can be sure
     if nums[i] larger than target, we need to put target on that index
3. if we loop through the whole nums array, and all the num are smaller than target
   we can return the len of the array

def SearchInsert(self, nums, target):
  if not nums or not target:
    return 0
  
  for i in range(len(nums)):
    if nums[i] >= target:
      return i
  
  return len(nums)
```
