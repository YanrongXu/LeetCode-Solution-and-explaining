Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the <strong>index</strong> if the target is found.
If not, return the <strong>index</strong> where it would be if it were inserted order.

###### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
```
###### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1
```
###### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4
```
###### Example 4:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 0
Output: 0
```
###### Example 5:
```
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: 0
```

#### Iterative (Bruth Force Way)
```python
1. Check if there is anything in the nums and anything in target
2. loop through the nums
  1. we knew that it is a sorting array, we can be sure
     if nums[i] larger than target, we need to put target on that index
3. if we loop through the whole nums array, and all the num are smaller than target
   we can return the len of the array

def SearchInsert(self, nums, target):
  if not nums or not target:
    return 0
  
  for i in range(len(nums)):
    if nums[i] >= target:
      return i
  
  return len(nums)
```

#### Binary Search(Two pointer)
```python
1. check if there is anything in the nums and anything in target
2. set the initial start and end pointer
3. check if the start and end point is meet
  1. cut the array in half, and note down the midpoint
  2. check if the mid is smaller or larget than midpoint
    1. if the midpoint smaller than target:
      1.set the start to the midpoint
    2. if the midpoint larger than target:
      1. set the end to the midpoint
4. check if the start point larger target
  1. return start
5. else: just return the endpoint

def searchInsert(self, nums, target):
  if not nums or len(nums) == 0:
    return 0
  
  start, end = 0, len(nums)
  while start + 1 < end:
    mid = (start + end) // 2
    if nums[mid] <= target:
      start = mid
    else:
      end = mid
  
  if nums[start] >= target:
    return start
  return end
```
