Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.
  
For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:
> A binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in heighy by no more than 1.
  
#### Example 1:
![example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/06/balance_1.jpg)
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: true
```

#### Example 2:
![example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/06/balance_2.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
Output: false
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: root = []
Output: true
```

#### Constrains:
  * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000]
  * -10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4

Recursive (DFS)
```python
Step:
1.  using a helper function to validate the root is balance is save the result of balance as true and false
    1.  valiadte the node, in this case is the root
        1.  check if there is a root: if not renru true, and level 0
        2.  check if the left of the root are balanced
        3.  if left of root is not balanced return False
        4.  check if the right of the root are balanced
        5.  if right of root is not balanced return False
        6.  return the true and false result of absoluton value of left height and right height is less than and equal to 1
            and the max(left_heigh, right_height) + 1
2.  return the result of balance

def isBalanced(self, root):
    balanced, _ = self.validate(root)
    return balanced

def validate(self, root):
    if not root:
        return True, 0
    
    balanced, left_height = self.validate(root.left)
    if not balanced:
        return False, 0
    balanced, right_height = self.validate(root.right)
    if not balanced:
        return False, 0
    return abs(left_height - right_height) <= 1, max(left_height, right_height) + 1
```
